# Black Stories Matter API
The goal of Black Stories Matter API is to build a database of children's books by Black authors for educators, families and youth.
If a book is not already listed, users can visit the API interface to add children's books by Black authors to the database.
Add a title by entering the 10 digit ISBN number assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication to add it to the database.
